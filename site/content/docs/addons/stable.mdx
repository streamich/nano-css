# stable

Ensures deterministic class name generation across JavaScript environments by using `fastest-stable-stringify` instead of `JSON.stringify`.

This is important for server-side rendering — without it, class names generated on the server may not match the client.

## Installation

```js
import { addon as addonStable } from 'nano-css/addon/stable';
addonStable(nano);
```

> **Tip:** If you name all your rules explicitly (e.g. `rule(css, 'MyButton')`), you don't need this addon.
