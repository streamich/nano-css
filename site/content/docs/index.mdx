# Introduction

**nano-css** is a tiny 5th generation CSS-in-JS library. It has a very small core of only ~0.5 Kb and provides all additional features through a modular addon system.

## Why nano-css?

- **Tiny footprint** — ~0.5 Kb core vs ~15 Kb for styled-components
- **Framework agnostic** — works with React, Preact, Vue.js, or standalone
- **Isomorphic** — server and browser with stable class names and re-hydration
- **Fast** — uses `.insertRule()` and style caching for high performance
- **Modular** — pick only the addons you need, keep your bundle small
- **Full-featured** — `@media` queries, `@keyframes`, vendor prefixes, nesting, and more

## How It Works

nano-css follows a simple pattern: create a renderer, then extend it with addons.

```js
import { create } from 'nano-css';
import { addon as addonRule } from 'nano-css/addon/rule';
import { addon as addonAtoms } from 'nano-css/addon/atoms';

const nano = create();
addonRule(nano);
addonAtoms(nano);

const className = nano.rule({
  col: 'red',        // atoms shorthand for "color"
  bdrad: '4px',      // atoms shorthand for "border-radius"
});
```

Each addon is a function that receives the renderer object and extends it with new methods or behavior.

## Architecture

The library is organized into several layers:

| Layer | Examples | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Core** | `put()`, `putRaw()` | The minimal renderer — inject CSS by selector |
| **Rules** | `rule()`, `drule()`, `sheet()`, `dsheet()` | Generate class names from CSS objects |
| **Styling** | `jsx()`, `style()`, `styled()` | Create styled components for virtual DOM libraries |
| **Utilities** | `atoms`, `nesting`, `keyframes`, `prefixer` | Enhance CSS authoring with shortcuts and features |
| **Advanced** | `virtual`, `vcssom`, `hydrate`, `extract` | Performance optimizations and build-time tools |

## Getting Started

Head to the [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) guide to set up nano-css in your project,
or explore the [Addons](/docs/addons) to see what's available.

## Recommended Setup

For most projects, we recommend using a [preset](/docs/getting-started/presets) or setting up a
dedicated configuration file. See the [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation) guide for details.
