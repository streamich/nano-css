# extract

Enables CSS extraction into external style sheets at build time by:

- Eagerly injecting styles from `sheet()` (normally lazy)
- Rendering `jsx()` and `style()` components with default props

This is a low-level building block for build-time extraction workflows.

## Installation

```js
import { addon as addonExtract } from 'nano-css/addon/extract';
addonExtract(nano);
```
