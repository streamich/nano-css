# Server-Side Rendering

In non-browser environments, nano-css accumulates CSS as a string in the `raw` property instead of injecting into the DOM.

```js
html += `<style>${nano.raw}</style>`;
```

## Re-hydrating

Install the [hydrate](/docs/advanced/hydrate) addon and provide your style sheet element:

```js
const nano = create({
  sh: typeof document === 'object'
    ? document.getElementById('nano-css')
    : null,
});
```

nano-css will skip CSS rules that are already present in the style sheet.

## External Style Sheet Extraction

Use the [extract](/docs/advanced/extract) addon to extract styles into an external CSS file at build time.
