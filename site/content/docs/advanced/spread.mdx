# spread()

Like `rule()`, but returns an object with data attributes that can be spread.

```jsx
const rule = nano.spread({ color: 'red' });

<div {...rule}>Hello world!</div>
```

Can also be stringified for a class name:

```jsx
<div className={rule}>Hello world!</div>
```

## Installation

```js
import { addon as addonSpread } from 'nano-css/addon/spread';
addonSpread(nano);
```
